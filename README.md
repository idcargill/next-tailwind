## NEXT-tailwind Project Starter 

A nextjs configured environement for starting new projects.

After forking and installing this repo you can test and edit linter settings before running a script to reset the project. 

#### Project Configuration:

- [nextjs 13](https://nextjs.org/docs) w/ [rust compiler](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/compiler) (no babel)
- [React18](https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18.html) with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
- Testing with [jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)



### Start New Project

- fork this repo
- name it something cool

install dependencies:
```bash
yarn
```

### Linting

To test and inspect lint settings:
> src/sections/LintTest.tsx

Feel free to make any eslint or project environemnt changes.


To checkout the base setup and any changes run the server with:
```bash
yarn dev
```

View examples on your local server
> localhost:3000

### Clear Examples

Once you are happy with your eslint (or before) reset the project.
This will remove the example files but keep configuration settings.

To test tailwind css: localhost:3000/css
> src/sections/CssPage/cssPageLayout.tsx

To remove the custom examples and get a fresh project, run:

```bash
yarn tabulaRasa
```

This will remove:

- src/sections
- reset src/pages/index.tsx
- ./tabulaRasa.sh

### Testing

Run all tests:
> yarn test

To test while working on a single file like you should (TDD):
> yarn test-file

Generate test coverage:
> yarn test-coverage
